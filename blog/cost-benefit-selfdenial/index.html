	<p>How many plastic bags must you foresake in order to carbon-offset a return flight to Bangkok? How many minutes of hot shower is that? Or, perhaps more realistically, how many iPads?</p>

<p>We all know the shopping list of green good deeds. Less waste, better home insulation, shorter showers and colder wash cycles, low-power light bulbs, fewer kilometers in the car and plane. Some people even know that electronic gadgets come with (lots of) emissions &quot;bundled&quot; at purchase, and that if you enjoy suburban living and brand new cars, it will take a lot of foresaken iPads to offset the damage.</p>

<p>But how many, exactly? Seems to me that this is today&#39;s information gap. Which are the big-ticket acts of self-denial, and just how much smaller are the others? Individuals value things – car, holidays, gadgets, housing – differently. If we can better understand the relative importance of our deeds then we will surely be able to weigh them better against our own priorities, and make the right choices. Which might not even hurt that much.</p>
