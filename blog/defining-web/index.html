	<h1>Defining the web</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2013-09-25</div>
	<p>Like all responsible citizens, I back up my files both locally and online. My online backup service has a web interface, which is occasionally useful but also uncomfortable – after all, it means my private files are technically &quot;on the web&quot;.</p>

<p>Or does it? How about webmail? Those who dismiss Facebook&#39;s privacy settings, insisting that &quot;you must assume it&#39;s public if you put it online&quot;, presumably don&#39;t think the same of their email. But it too has a URL.</p>

<p>In reality, &quot;on the web&quot; is a concept of graded reality: </p>

<ol>
<li>it has a URL starting with &quot;http&quot; – you access it using the web&#39;s protocol, HTTP;</li>
<li>it has a unique URL starting with &quot;http&quot; – only a URL pointing to a single document is useful;</li>
<li>it has a unique URL starting with &quot;http&quot; and no authentication – at this point all someone needs is the link, hence...</li>
<li>it has a unique URL starting with &quot;http&quot;, no authentication, and is linked to a page with all the same characteristics</li>
</ol>

<p>I submit that only web pages in the category 4 are unambiguously &quot;on the web&quot;. In category 3, search results pages are a classic border case. As for the shady category 2, the term &quot;dark web&quot; is starting to be useful. And the list of my files at GenericWebBackup.com, with a shared URL for everyone and armor-plated password security, is really not on the web at all. That&#39;s a relief.</p>
