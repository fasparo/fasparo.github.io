	<h1>An alternative to independence</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-10-24</div>
	<p>It seems that whenever I visit Barcelona there are Catalan flags hanging from every window. The most recent time it was because of a pseudo-referendum on independence for Catalonia (which was only pseudo-won). Scotland and Quebec have each had multiple real referendums. Apparently all three countries will keep voting every decade or two until one day, maybe, the answer is Yes.</p>

<p>This is a silly situation. In Catalonia, as in Quebec and Scotland, the sensible majority does not want full sovereignty. Few taxpayers in the 21st century will vote to pay for separate armed forces and embassies in the name of an abstract principle. But they are not looking for perks either. Extreme decentralization (Spain), full linguistic equality (Canada) or advantageous tax arrangements (the UK) will never be enough. Because what Catalans and Quebeckers and Scots really want is simple: recognition that their nations are equal among others. Unfortunately, since the 19th century that means having a state.</p>

<p>The solution is therefore clear. The international community must create, by means of a UN treaty, a new status of <em>autonomous community</em>. The accession requirement would be an agreed set of competences relating to constitutional arrangements and in particular taxation. Existing and aspiring regions could apply for the status, and accepted members would be represented in relevant UN bodies.</p>

<p>At last the combustible bond between nations and states would be weakened. An internationally respected complement to traditional statehood would emerge, allowing nations to assert their dignity without the need to destroy existing states. In extreme cases civil wars might be averted. At the very least the Catalans of Barcelona might at last put away their flags.</p>
