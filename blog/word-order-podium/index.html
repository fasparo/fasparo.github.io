	<p>In German, auxiliary verbs come at the end of the sentence. In the phrase, &quot;I have baked a Black Forest gateau with an iced strawberry meringue topping&quot;, we hear all about the cake before finding out what the speaker actually did with it. That seems illogical.</p>

<p>In English the verb is sensibly up front, but nouns come after adjectives. Listening to &quot;Big, shiny, black Audi&quot; pronounced slowly, you must mentally picture an abstract big, shiny black thing before you know it is a car. Not ideal.</p>

<p>French suffers from neither of these deficiencies. Then again, neither does the Malagasy language, which even puts the verb before the subject and has no genders to learn. Something else to save in Madagascar, besides lemurs.</p>
