	<h1>The meaning of streaming</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2014-10-21</div>
	<p>At first sight, Spotify seems an abomination to anyone who cares about freedom online. Your music is locked down by DRM, you lose access to it if you stop paying, and Big Record Industry is monitoring what you listen to and when. But look a bit closer and things become less clear.</p>

<p>In the past you would pay 10 kopeks every month and get a lifetime listening licence, with no spying, to one very carefully chosen album. 12 per year, which you could augment by copying your friends&#39; ones. Not a terrible deal.</p>

<p>But 10 kopeks per month paid to Spotify today will get you so much more. Namely the same lifetime licence, but to practically all the music in the world. No copying allowed – but if you <em>really</em> want to, you can. And Spotify is watching your every move – but that allows it to pay artists per-listen, an optimal solution which was never possible before. Of course, you can&#39;t stop paying and keep your music – but then you kept paying under the previous regime too. Streaming might even be more ecologically sustainable: it uses a lot of internet bandwidth, but clearly less total storage space, even allowing for mass caching.</p>

<p>The issue of listening data is still enough to put off some, including me. But apart from that information, nothing personal is being leaked to Big Cloud. As for the music itself, the concept of ownership is surely as inappropriate as usual for this field: it is not <em>your</em> music and it never will be.</p>

<p>Commercial music streaming is not only an amazing deal, it is an efficient solution to existing problems and costs relatively little in lost privacy. The argument, at least, is solid.</p>
