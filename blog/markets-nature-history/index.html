	<p>Is consumer capitalism compatible with ecology? Can growth ever be green, really? This question had been troubling me for a while until I eventually came to the unsatisfying conclusion, &quot;Probably not&quot;. After all, if better efficiency makes energy cheaper, what will stop people just using more of it (the &quot;rebound effect&quot;)? And even if ecosystem services are priced, what will protect those services from overuse if the money supply increases? But there&#39;s a more transcendental reason to be sceptical of the market&#39;s green credentials: history. The collosal damage already done to the environment happened under the current system. Perhaps that system can be adapted to take account of ecological constraints. To make this assumption (as many are doing) is probably unreasonable and therefore reckless. But it is certainly unempirical, since it ignores history.</p>
