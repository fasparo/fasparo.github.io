	<p>Economic growth is the orthodox left-wing antidote to debt. But green growth will not exist until the ecological impact of each unit of output starts to fall faster than the rate of that output&#39;s growth. And even supposing that becomes possible, no growth at all (and no impact at all) will always be better for the environment.</p>

<p>The quickest route to sustainable economics is to pay back debt and to spend the money on ecosystem restoration (investment) rather than more stuff (consumption). In economic terms at least, that looks a lot like traditional conservatism.</p>
