	<h1>Care</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2012-10-10</div>
	<p>As hunter-gatherers on the plains of Africa, humans cared about themselves and their immediate family. With agriculture and settlement, they began to care about the other people they lived with. Religion and nationalism were reasons for humans to care about tribespeople that they had never even met. In the twentieth century we at last saw into the lives of all humanity, and we cared. In the twenty-first century we need to start caring about non-humanity, all the other species in the extended family of life.</p>
