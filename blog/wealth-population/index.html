	<p>According to demographic theory, family size declines with rising prosperity. Meanwhile, human impacts on ecosystems are widely believed to be a factor of prosperity and population.</p>

<p>Assuming that basic material comfort is a non-negotiable right, there is therefore ultimately only one way to contain environmental damage â€“ everyone must get rich as quick as possible. That is the green case for capitalism.</p>

<p>But there is a catch. For this formula to function, free societies must continue to respect two killer injunctions. Family size must stay small, and per-capita wealth must stop growing. Perhaps that is the green case for social democracy.</p>
