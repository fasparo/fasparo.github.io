	<p>Why talk in trademarks – iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, Kindle, Twitter, Skype, Outlook, Powerpoint, GDoc, Facebook and Google – when generic words are available?</p>

<p>Tablet, music player, phone, music store, e-reader, microblog, chat, spreadsheet, mail, doc, social network and search – do these terms mean less, or are they just less cool? (RSS, an almost-trademark, is not even cool. Perhaps it would be more popular if they had just gone with &quot;web feed&quot;.)</p>

<p>I always make an effort to use the generic vocab. It&#39;s semantically transparent (what would an &quot;iPod&quot; be if you didn&#39;t know already?). It&#39;s public, it&#39;s open. Above all, it&#39;s a subtle declaration of independence, of confidence that these companies and products will one day be replaced by things better. Better for us – as consumers with choice, but also as citizens with autonomy.</p>
