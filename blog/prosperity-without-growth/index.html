	<h1>Prosperity without growth</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2013-11-28</div>
	<p>I am sold on Tim Jackson&#39;s theoretical &quot;economics for a finite planet&quot;.</p>

<p>In his thesis, <em>Prosperity without Growth</em>, he follows Amartya Sen by defining prosperity as &quot;capability for flourishing&quot;, and singles out economic growth as the increasingly irrelevant obsession which is undermining shared prosperity.</p>

<p>GDP ignores good activity, such as volunteering and recycling, and counts bad activity, including the plunder of finite resources. Prosperity in material terms alone is bounded by real-world ecological limits – the earth&#39;s resources and pollution sinks – as modulated by population. But in the rich world, prosperity now means relationships, work and health, not GDP. Economic growth is the answer to a problem that has been solved, just as Keynes himself suggested it might one day be. This is the Club of Rome narrative which even enjoyed a plurality of support in 1970s opinion polls.</p>

<p>Tim Jackson elaborates on the analysis by debunking the myth of sustainable growth, by explaining growth&#39;s infernal modern psychology, and by outlining an alternative &quot;green macroeconomics&quot;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sustainable growth is hard</strong> because it implies an absolute decoupling of economic output and resource impacts. Relative decoupling is underway, but the absolute variety would require that efficiency gains consistently outpace the product of affluence and population. These are both rising at 2% annually whereas efficiency (meaning technology improvements) has never managed more than 2%. Even a 1.4% undershoot means 80% more impact by 2050.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The culture of growth</strong> is engendered by constant labour productivity gains, which force governments to push consumer spending in order to avoid unemployment and a spiral of recession. These productivity gains are caused by a combination of creative destruction and consumer novelty-seeking, which Tim Jackson calls the &quot;iron cage of consumerism&quot;. Consumerism is further explained by social signalling and status competition, abetted by government policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An alternative macroeconomic model</strong> would internalize the value of ecosystem services and the regenerative capacity of renewable resources. It would mean a permanent shift from consumption to green investment, financed by taxes and bonds. Unemployment would be tackled with a citizen&#39;s income and encouragement for dematerialized labor-intensive service sectors, including the &quot;Cinderella economy&quot; – care, craft and culture. Public policy would favor income equality, volunteering, leisure, intrinsic social values and long-termism.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for putting all this into effect, Tim Jackson imagines a three-stage road map: (1) establish the limits and implement caps, (2) fix the economic model, (3) change the social logic.</p>

<p>Of course, it all sounds like utopian left-wingery. But I think it will turn out to be the only way forward. Science says so.</p>
