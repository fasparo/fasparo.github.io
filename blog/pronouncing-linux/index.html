	<h1>Pronouncing Linux</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2013-07-21</div>
	<p>What a mess Linus Torvalds made when naming his kernel. According to the rules of English phonics, it should be pronounced &quot;laɪnəks&quot; (&quot;lye-nooks&quot;). But since many English speakers never absorbed phonics, a lot of people were soon calling it &quot;lɪnəks&quot; (&quot;linnooks&quot;, which would be &quot;linnux&quot; under phonics). Linus at first gave his blessing to this latter, incorrect pronunciation (which is the most popular), before explaining that he himself pronounces it something like &quot;liːnʉks&quot; (&quot;leenooks&#39;&quot;) – the way it is said in every language but English. I suggest we copy him. English just isn&#39;t up to the job.</p>
