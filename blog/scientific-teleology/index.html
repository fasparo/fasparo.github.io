	<p>In the Middle Ages, people knew that the Earth was at the centre of the universe. A few hundred years ago, doctors still used bloodletting as a remedy. In the early 20th century, a lot of smart people were certain that the Earth was solid.</p>

<p>The historical trap of teleology – seeing past events as predetermined – surely applies also to science in the present. On questions of animal intelligence (&quot;of course humans are the smartest&quot;), toxicity (&quot;it could not possibly be dangerous&quot;), economics (&quot;more growth is clearly needed&quot;) and countless others, the founding principle of science is easily forgotten. Everything is theory, and and every theory must be reassessed, again and again.</p>
