	<p>Is it possible to be &quot;united in diversity&quot;? The EU&#39;s motto expresses the ambiguity at the heart of federalism, and so fuels the fear that underlies EU-scepticism.</p>

<p>The fear looks reasonable. As is implied by the ominous term &quot;European integration&quot;, the sharing of laws is likely to make Europe more integrated, or &quot;whole&quot;. In general, states which pool sovereignty are destined to lose parts of their historic characters.</p>

<p>But they are not destined to become one state. Federalism demands nothing more than respect for a treaty.</p>

<p>Perhaps the key is to understand &quot;diversity&quot; in its literal, rather than historical, sense. An ideal federation is not a union, but a community of best practice. Each state pioneers its own laws, and occasionally the best laws are generalized to the other states. Only a state which never asserts its difference, which never tries anything new, need fear losing its identity.</p>

<p>So a federation can indeed be united in diversity. But only if that diversity is invented and created, not inherited. Perhaps that is why federalism is scary to Europe.</p>
