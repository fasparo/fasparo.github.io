	<p>Humans are supposed to be different to, and better than, other animals. So let us imagine a &quot;civilisation test&quot; for any given human behavior. What would we think if we saw another species doing it?</p>

<p>How would we interpret the sight of a lemming leaping from a cliff – only not just leaping but also dragging its unwilling clifftop companions with it into oblivion? What about a gang of apes tying down one of their members and, slowly, ritually killing it? Difficult to picture?</p>

<p>So let us imagine instead a group of rats shipwrecked on a bountiful tropical island – and then, in our minds, fast-forward a few generations to the inevitable outcome, for the island at least.</p>

<p>For all our achievements, we would fail our own test badly.</p>
