	<h1>Paying for news online</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2014-09-08</div>
	<p>News organisations are tying themselves in knots over the question of how to charge users for content. Should it be per-article or subscription? Should the recent stuff be free, or the archives? And then there are apps, superfluously and expensively balkanised into multiple platforms, but which can at least be sold in virtual stores like the paper of yore. Even today, uninformed journalists are persuading themselves the future is rosy because of apps â€“ the same journalists who have never themselves bought an app or indeed paid for any digital content. </p>

<p>I think the reality is much simpler. Information wants to be free, and in free society it will find a way to be. But consumers are also citizens. Increasingly they will see through the charade of paying for data as though it were physical property. The way forward is to provide them every possible means of giving something back, and to flatter them for it. The motivation of tomorrow&#39;s news consumers will be philanthrophic, not commercial.</p>
