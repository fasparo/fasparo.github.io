	<p>By now everyone accepts that if you post to a blog or Twitter, your thoughts are public, forever. Likewise, we all agree that it would be Completely Unacceptable for a webmail provider to leak your email to anyone at all, let alone the general public.</p>

<p>But for many, it seems, the concept of limited sharing is uncomfortably complicated. &quot;Anything you post on the internet is public&quot;, say the more outspoken sceptics. Others denounce Facebook for its weasely approach to privacy and then conclude that we would be dumb to expect better. Cynicism added to muddled thinking.</p>

<p>The ambiguous area between public and private speech is what makes the internet special. &quot;Few-to-few&quot; communication – perhaps it could be rebranded &quot;confidential&quot; or &quot;semi-public&quot; – had never been possible before. It should be defended and promoted.</p>
