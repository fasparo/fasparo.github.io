	<p>Athletes, Californians and even scientists seem to be accepting the health virtues of the paleo diet (consisting of meat, non-grain plants, and more meat). That is rational. Grain-based agriculture is a recent development in human evolution, after all. But is such a game-fish-nut-and-berry diet sustainable in a world of 7 billion people?</p>

<p>This seems to be a good example of how humans have boxed themselves in with technology. Farming and fossil fuels allowed us to populate the planet like a plague, at the price of a transformed diet and lifestyle. It would now be impossible for us all to switch back to the ways for which evolution has prepared us. There are just too many of us. We will be eating grain for a while yet.</p>
