	<h1>Open tip jar</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-01-18</div>
	<p>Journalism seems at last to be adapting to the internet without reservations. But now it must face another risk: the temptation of selling its soul to that cartel of US-based corporations and services and platforms whose names do not need to be mentioned.</p>

<p>For an optimist, the destiny of every corporate web service is to be replaced by an open standard.</p>

<p>One standard surely waiting to happen is a P2P tip jar, to enable anonymous commission-free micropayments by consumers to content producers. Perhaps, as pioneered by Flattr, the payments could be aggregated and calculated monthly according to a predefined budget. Or they could simply be one-off donations as in the model being tried by YouTube. But, thanks to Bitcoin or some future successor crypto-currency, no Californian cloud-corporation would need to be paid off with fees and consumption metadata.</p>

<p>An open-source tip jar would be useful to some bloggers right now and surely all journalists in the future.</p>
