	<h1>A single relevant news feed</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-09-11</div>
	<p>To follow people on Twitter as a means of finding news is to get an edited news feed in return for delegating to others your choice of sources. Alternatively, subscribing directly to news producers by RSS is to get a firehose in return for the privilege of choosing your own sources. In the first case you control the filter but not the source, in the second the source but not the filter.</p>

<p>There are partial solutions to this conundrum. One is to follow both individuals and news organizations on Twitter, and put up with the inevitable firehose. Another is to give up and delegate the whole thing to an unaccountable algorithm, in other words Facebook. A more idealistic approach is to use RSS to follow a judicious mix of organizations and bloggers, which gets you a measure of curation but without Twitter&#39;s famous what-I-had-for-breakfast noise. But even that is not ideal, for the simple and unfortunate reason that most of today&#39;s bloggers are not blogging but rather tweeting and facebooking, thereby giving up their own data and obliging their readers to do the same. </p>

<p>It seems then that in 2015 there is no single place to get a relevant internet news feed, and certainly no way to do it without surrendering choice and personal data. A sadly familiar situation.</p>
