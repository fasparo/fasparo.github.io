	<h1>Reimagining the frontier</h1>

	<p>In the standard narrative of human progress, the figurative frontier of our knowledge is also literal. We crossed the oceans 500 years ago, leapt into space a half-century back, and now our robots are scouting Mars looking for places to plant our flag.</p>

<p>The narrative is less inspiring than it was. Mars, like the Moon, is a cold and dead place. The rest of the solar system is the same, just more extreme. Untold bounties are promised by countless exoplanets, but the nearest such world is impossibly far away and might as well be in a different dimension.</p>

<p>Tech utopians will dream, but science is about reality. We are all slightly bored of that world map with its familiar coastlines, but there will be no replacement any time soon. We are stuck on Earth.</p>

<p>The smart response should be clear. We must look again at what we have. We must accept that we have not understood it all and never will. And we must learn to appreciate expanding our knowledge within an unchanging spatial frontier.</p>

<p>It is anything but a dispiriting manifesto. In the famous Apollo 8 photo, the Earth looks a small place. But it is still the size it was when our ancestors crossed its continents and seas for the first time. Lacking technology, they took months and lifetimes. They experienced danger and novelty, but they also missed almost everything on the way.</p>

<p>Our challenge, then, is to stop thinking big and distant and instead to think small and near. To put away the world map and instead open a local one. Once again to understand the Earth as a place of frontiers, as an endlessly complex universe in itself, which we have not even begun to understand.</p>
