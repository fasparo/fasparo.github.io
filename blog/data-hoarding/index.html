	<h1>Data hoarding</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-08-21</div>
	<p>It seems to be a human instinct to want to build personal collections of other people&#39;s data.</p>

<p>In the pre-networked age this had a practical aspect. Shelves of books, VHS tapes and CDs were necessary if ever you wanted to consume the information a second time. In the case of books, the dusty tomes served the additional purpose of making you look cultured. They still do, apparently.</p>

<p>But what justification is there today for building virtual libraries of .mpegs and .flacs and .epubs? Not much, as far as I can tell. Music and films and TV series are readily available in streaming form or as disposable downloads, legal or otherwise. As for books, they are perhaps the strangest thing of all to keep on one&#39;s SSD – because let&#39;s face it, very few people regularly read the same book twice. Many are no doubt motivated by a subconscious need to keep track of <em>what</em> they have consumed, following a logic of personal development – that is, they are more interested in the metadata than the data. But in that case it would be simple enough just to keep a list of the book titles and movie titles and the like. Ultimately this whole phenomenon looks like just another facet of modern consumerism, itself only the latest embodiment of humanity&#39;s ravenous appetite for Stuff.</p>

<p>I think we would do well to make a better distinction between impersonal data – to be consumed and then tossed into the digital trash, where it requires no electrical current and no datacenters – and the personal sort, which is worth saving, treasuring and perhaps even publishing. The impersonal metadata is part of that, but only a vanishingly small part.</p>
