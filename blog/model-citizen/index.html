	<h1>A model citizen</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2013-05-17</div>
	<p>A society is the sum of its citizens. For every bad citizen you need several good ones. For each non-voter you need a couple of voters, and for every ten passive couch potatoes you need one activist, a super-citizen â€“ someone to inspire, to lead by example, to put society on the right course or keep it there.</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz was to me the very example of this idea. In a ridiculously short life he helped build several gifts to public technology (RSS, RDF-XML, Markdown) and online civic tools (Open Library, Watchdog.net, Demand Progress), before becoming a full-blown campaigner on civil liberties and helping defeat America&#39;s Stop Online Piracy Act.</p>

<p>He embodied the universal injunction of being the change you want to see. I can&#39;t help but compare this rota of selfless achievement to my own modest oeuvre, and I suppose others have done the same. A sobering exercise, but also useful inspiration.</p>
