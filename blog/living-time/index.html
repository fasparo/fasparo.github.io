	<p>In my experience, a strange thing happens when you start to use a bicycle as transport: walking suddenly seems hopelessly slow. Presumably if you upgrade to a scooter, the bike in turn will immediately appear a waste of time. Certainly, to people who fly regularly, even high-speed trains seem as plodding as treacle. Five hours, you say? Impossible.</p>

<p>The same phenomenon is at work everywhere in modern life. Why wait till tomorrow, or even half an hour, for your news when Twitter can provide the gist of it right now? Email may be more polite, but the phone is quicker – so call. Why bother preparing a meal from raw ingredients when you can heat some packet and be eating in an instant? And, yes, there will be another train along in three minutes, but then you will never get back those 120 seconds – so <em>run</em>!</p>

<p>Speed and efficiency are the metrics of capitalism. They have filled our wallets, but also polluted our minds. Life has become something for later, when in fact it is happening right now. The walk to work; the five-hour train journey; the time spent anticipating and digesting news, and meals; the little routines that make up a day; the unproductive wait in all its forms. To see them as dead time is, by definition, to live a dead life.</p>
