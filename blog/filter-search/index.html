	<h1>Filter versus search</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2013-12-22</div>
	<p>America has a great tradition of corporate euphemism. Lobbyists are &quot;public affairs consultants&quot;. Used cars are &quot;pre-owned&quot;, and even &quot;pre-loved&quot;.</p>

<p>But on the web &quot;search&quot; is still &quot;search&quot;. This seems odd. The prospect of &quot;searching&quot; for something is hardly one to lift the soul. It sounds like a drudge to me. After all, people don&#39;t go to Google to &quot;search&quot;. They go there to <em>find</em>!</p>

<p>It is time &quot;search&quot; was euphemized to &quot;filter&quot;, since that is what it is. Google could be rebranded a &quot;web filtering company&quot;. A euphemism which is also technically correct â€“ that would be a first.</p>
