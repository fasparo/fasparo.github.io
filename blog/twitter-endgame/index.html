	<h1>Twitter endgame</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2014-08-30</div>
	<p>Microblogging was invented by Twitter and for this the company deserves some success. Besides, any company endorsed by A-list celebrities and heads of state seems to me a good medium-term investment bet.</p>

<p>But the case against Twitter is strong:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 140-character limit is entirely arbitrary, post-facto excuses notwithstanding. Its very logic is undermined by the varying-length &quot;@&quot;s and &quot;#&quot;s and URLs. The limit functions as a crutch for indiscipline, but not all writers are undisciplined.</p></li>
<li><p>Plain-text links are surely Twitter&#39;s original sin. Their inevitable consequence was link shorteners, which have spent the last few years breaking the web. A discrete URL field would have solved the problem at source.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike e-mail, Twitter is proprietary rather than open-source. And unlike RSS it is site-based rather than distributed. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first two flaws are technical and the company will surely end up fixing them. But the last is intractable.</p>

<p>One day Twitter will be disrupted by an open standard. Its only choice will be whether to fight destiny or to become part of the solution.</p>
