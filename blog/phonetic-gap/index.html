	<p>If you were to read this sentence aloud, would listeners hear the difference between the brackets (also called parentheses) and the dashes – sometimes confused with hyphens – and if not, then why are both used?</p>

<p>Similarly, in this sentence, it is not clear Watt kicked off the industrial &quot;revolution&quot;, or that the sentence&#39;s author doubts the revolution&#39;s authenticity [whether or not it is he speaking].</p>

<p>Most non-alphabetic writing symbols are verbalized – numbers, pluses, equalses, ats, asterisks, slashes (except &quot;and/or&quot;, which really needs to become a regular word). Question marks and exclamation marks are made explicit by tone. But many others are just implied. Colons, semicolons, commas, full stops, dashes, brackets and quotation marks are all just meaningless silences in speech.</p>

<p>The obvious interpretation is that written language is just semantically richer than the oral variety. But then Western writing systems are supposed to be based on verbal language. Their speakability is their great advantage compared to East Asian ideograms. Perhaps I&#39;ve been poisoned by programming, but all that ambiguity seems kinda ugly to me.</p>
