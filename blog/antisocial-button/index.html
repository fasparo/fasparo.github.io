	<p>Social buttons do not belong on webpages. They are ugly, slow, a pain for developers to maintain, and in theory superfluous. Sharing, liking, tweeting, annotating, upvoting and downvoting are all pure meta. The tools they require are content-transverse and have no place in the content layer.</p>

<p>What would it take to get the buttons into the browser toolbar, where they belong? After all, Google is not going to install a Facebook button in Chrome without a fight.</p>

<p>Enter Firefox, the browser&#39;s browser. Mozilla should create and maintain an independently-verified registry of social networks, ranked according to their audited traffic and user numbers. For each of the leading usual suspects Firefox should add a native button to its toolbar, perhaps with dropdown functionality for different verbs (upvote, share, and so on). Then it should proceed to block the corresponding scripts for page-based buttons.</p>

<p>Firefox users would thus get a speed boost and a more beautiful web. And perhaps, just perhaps, that would be enough to get the corporate browsers to copy.</p>
