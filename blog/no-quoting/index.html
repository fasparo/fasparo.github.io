	<p>According to received wisdom, email is obsolete. Partly for intractable technical reasons relating to security. But also because it encourages people to compose messages like 19th-century letter-writers, with lots of &quot;Dear so-and-so&quot; and &quot;Best regards&quot;, when they should be firing off laconic one-liners and generally getting to the point.</p>

<p>As a result, modern email clients look like chat apps. Messages are fully displayed in threads and users are urged to &quot;quick reply&quot; in two-line boxes underneath each message. The threading is assisted by two headers, <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>In-Reply-To</code>, which enable clients to understand the relationship between individual messages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why are we still including </p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 previous messages in nested quotes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>underneath each e-mail?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this now-useless quoting does not help email&#39;s plodding reputation. Even if the quotations are hidden, they must be responsible for a huge proportion of email&#39;s bandwidth and carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be pragmatic and surrender to the chattification of email. The first step is to turn off automatic quoting.</p>
