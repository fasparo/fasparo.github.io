<p>At the start, the World Wide Web was a network of pages connected by hyperlinks. These days, the web is everything you want it to be. Specifically, it is a platform for both documents and applications. This dual function – docs and apps, getting and doing, noun and verb – is widely celebrated as the web&#39;s great strength.</p>

<p>But the web&#39;s hybridity too often makes for bad usability. In the beginning, any clicked interactive element – a link or a button – would trigger a page refresh. Today, omnipresent Javascript means that a click will sometimes produce an instantaneous result, and sometimes an unexpected wait of several seconds while an entire page is loaded.</p>

<p>Before clicking, does the user not have the right to know whether a page refresh will be triggered?</p>

<p>I propose an obvious design pattern to resolve the conundrum. Links should be for getting pages, and buttons should be for doing stuff. Any textual link means a new page, and perhaps a short wait. And any button (styled flexibly, including form submit buttons if possible) means instant inline feedback. Simple.</p>
