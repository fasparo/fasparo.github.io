	<h1>Political consumption</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2014-04-29</div>
	<p>Humanity needs to consume less. Less energy, and less stuff.</p>

<p>The good news is that capitalism allows this, in theory. Constant efficiency improvements mean that we are getting ever more value out of each unit of energy and each kilogram of raw material.</p>

<p>The bad news is that capitalism does not want less consumption, as shown by the celebrated rebound effect. When technology improves, prices fall. And when prices fall, consumers have more to spend elsewhere. Hence cheaper electronics means better and newer gadgets; cheaper flights means more holidays; cheaper bills for LED public lighting might simply lead to brighter lights. Less expensive food could even pay for more air conditioning, since spending is by definition liquid.</p>

<p>If the market alone will not curb consumption, the obvious remedy is to modify price signals by way of taxes and regulation. As ever, politics is ultimately the only way forward.</p>

<p>But is it coherent, or even legitimate, to legislate for consumer behavior which has not arisen spontaneously? After all, consumers are citizens too, expressing their values by their choices. And that is the real case for individual action by consumers. Its effect is to justify and precipitate political action.</p>
