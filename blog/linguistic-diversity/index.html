	<h1>Dismantling Babel</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-07-26</div>
	<p>Language is the biodiversity of the human species. And just as there will be fewer species of butterfly tomorrow than there are today, there will be fewer languages. From 7000 to 700 by the end of the century, by one estimate.</p>

<p>Bad news, then. Or is it?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>There will never be a Shakespeare in Tongan.</strong> In practice languages grow by assimilation, usually by absorbing foreign vocabulary while discarding the useless grammar. The bulk of the world&#39;s tongues are still exclusively oral affairs with small, specialized lexicons. The best chance they have of expressing human experience to a wide audience is, ironically, to be assimilated and codified by a larger language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minority rhymes with inequality.</strong> Minority languages are protected alongside their cultures, and that means ignoring the rights of individuals. At the extreme, in Brazil, Amazonian tribes are kept physically separated from outsiders â€“ a form of apartheid which, most obviously, deprives people of access to modern medicine. Everywhere, minority-language speakers experience discrimation. Linguistic diversity is an invitation to tolerance, yes, but it should not be confused with political pluralism. True human equality can never be achieved as long as we are balkanised by language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To solve our problems we need to communicate.</strong> Companies and states use single languages for a reason: it allows them to cooperate more effectively. For the climate challenge alone, the premium on human cooperation has never been higher and the parable of the Tower of Babel has never looked more apt. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In nature diversity is essential. Within human culture it is beautiful but comes at a price. Perhaps technology can square the circle.</p>
