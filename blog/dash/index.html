	<p>Many conventions of typewriter antiquity have survived into the computer age. I can see one that remains logical: the use of &quot;dead keys&quot; to get diacritics (accents) onto characters. Most are the product of now-forgotten limitations, and are slowly dying out: underlining and caps instead of italics, first-line indents instead of proper paragraphs, tabbing in general. Proper smart quotes at last replace dumb ones, albeit with a bit of software help. (By the way, the modern equivalent of yesterday&#39;s physical typewriter constraint is plain text, and it has a modern solution: Markdown.)</p>

<p>Alas, the worst limitation of all was set in stone when modern keyboard-makers forgot to include a key &#8208; the dash. Or rather, a key â€“ the dash. So a generation of non-typographers has been forced to remember obscure key combinations (Alt+0150 on Windows, Cmd+- on Mac, Ctrl+Alt+U 2013 on Nix), or rely on Microsoft Word&#39;s conversion, or type two hyphens (the typewriter hack), or more likely just stuff it all and pretend the hyphen (which is already doubling as a minus) is a dash. A pity.</p>
