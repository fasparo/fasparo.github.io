	<h1>Expensive subscription</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">2015-02-13</div>
	<p>I recently decided not to renew my online subscription to The Economist. Partly I was motivated by irritation at The Economist&#39;s unthinking attachment to the dogma of growthism. For 10 years I paid The Economist to think for me, and they were not respecting the contract.</p>

<p>But mainly it was a result of something more prosaic – and harder for The Economist to remedy than changing its editorial line.</p>

<p>Traditionally, print news organisations sold their news as a package. 100 articles per day for a daily, or 100 per week in the case of The Economist. The model was perfectly suited to a world of information penury, where all news was paid-for and on paper. By necessity you would get your news mainly from a single source, or three if you were rich.</p>

<p>And it makes no sense today. It is the terrible paradox of online news subscriptions. I did not stop paying for The Economist because I no longer want to read it. I stopped because I now have 100 other news sources to follow – many amateur, most free and all of excellent quality. I only have time to read 10 Economist articles per week, and even the cheapest monthly subscription is therefore unacceptably expensive.</p>

<p>A seemingly intractable problem, then. That said, I&#39;m missing my weekly hit of The Economist already.</p>
