      <title>Delete the social button</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/antisocial-button</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social buttons do not belong on webpages. They are ugly, slow, a pain for developers to maintain, and in theory superfluous. Sharing, liking, tweeting, annotating, upvoting and downvoting are all pure meta. The tools they require are content-transverse and have no place in the content layer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dark modernity</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/dark-modernity</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is something strangely revolting about the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Race misunderstanding</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/race-misunderstanding</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The competitive connotations of &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;survival of the fittest&amp;quot; are nothing but a double linguistic misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Without religion</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/without-religion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two steps forward, one step back. To all those non-believers who sigh that religion &amp;quot;is a part of human nature&amp;quot;, just look at the figures. There have never been more atheists and agnostics in the world. Humanity is freeing itself from religion just as John Lennon imagined. One day most people will think for themselves, not as tools of gods but as human beings. They will look in wonder at the universe without resort to infantilising fairy tales, without absurd supernational justifications which leave them vulnerable to manipulation by extremists. It will happen, one day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Expensive subscription</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/expensive-subscription</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently decided not to renew my online subscription to The Economist. Partly I was motivated by irritation at The Economist&amp;#39;s unthinking attachment to the dogma of growthism. For 10 years I paid The Economist to think for me, and they were not respecting the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open tip jar</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/open-payment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism seems at last to be adapting to the internet without reservations. But now it must face another risk: the temptation of selling its soul to that cartel of US-based corporations and services and platforms whose names do not need to be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meat hypocrite</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/meat-hypocrite</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Factory farming is the cruel industrial revolution of the last half-century, I&amp;#39;ve discovered from Jonathan Safran Foer&amp;#39;s Eating Animals (2008). Over 99% of all farming in the rich world has, quite suddenly, become industrial. House prices and car prices have increased 14 or 15 times, but chicken prices have barely doubled. We now eat cheaply what we most want to eat: meat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Proxy religion</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/proxy-religion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Economic growth is the closest thing there is to a global religion. Rich and poor, left and right, Christians and Muslims and Buddhists and sub-Saharan animist pagans â€“ everyone except a handful of greens is certain that growth is the answer to life, universal prosperity and almost everything else. Because government investment. Because consumer buying power. And above all because jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Word order podium</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/word-order-podium</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In German, auxiliary verbs come at the end of the sentence. In the phrase, &amp;quot;I have baked a Black Forest gateau with an iced strawberry meringue topping&amp;quot;, we hear all about the cake before finding out what the speaker actually did with it. That seems illogical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The meaning of streaming</title>
      <link>http://fasparo.com/blog/meaning-streaming</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At first sight, Spotify seems an abomination to anyone who cares about freedom online. Your music is locked down by DRM, you lose access to it if you stop paying, and Big Record Industry is monitoring what you listen to and when. But look a bit closer and things become less clear.&lt;/p&gt;
